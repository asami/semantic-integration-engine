MCP Demo Workspace (SIE)
========================

This directory has been initialized by mcp-setup
to enable MCP-based access to the Semantic Integration Engine (SIE).

This workspace is temporary and disposable by design.


What was generated
------------------

The following files and directories were created by mcp-setup:

- bin/sie-mcp
    MCP launcher command executed by VS Code

- .vscode/settings.json
    Workspace-local MCP configuration

- (optional) local data directories for Fuseki / Chroma

No global settings were modified.


Available access methods
------------------------

You can interact with SIE using three different interfaces.


Option A: VS Code MCP (Recommended)
----------------------------------

1. Open this directory in VS Code
2. Open AI Tools / Codex
3. Select the MCP server named "sie-demo"
4. Use MCP tools such as query or explainConcept

This option is best for:
- Interactive exploration
- Development and experimentation
- Tool-driven workflows


Option B: ChatGPT MCP
--------------------

ChatGPT can connect directly to the MCP WebSocket endpoint:

    ws://localhost:9051/mcp

This option is useful for:
- Demonstrations without IDE setup
- Protocol-level inspection
- Reproducing examples from articles


Option C: REST API (Direct HTTP Access)
--------------------------------------

SIE also provides a traditional REST API:

    http://localhost:9050/sie/query

Example:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:9050/sie/query \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{ "query": "Explain SimpleModelObject." }'

The REST API and MCP API share the same semantic engine internally.


Cleanup
-------
