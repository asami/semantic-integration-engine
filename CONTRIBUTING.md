## 5. Coding Guidelines

### Scala (SmartDox / Cozy)
- Prefer functional style (pure functions, immutability)
- Use clear and explicit types
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Follow project formatting (`scalafmt` if configured)
- Provide unit tests when adding new behavior

### Documentation (SmartDox)
- Use SmartDox structured sections (HEAD / SUMMARY / LEAD / REMARKS)
- Prefer bilingual (EN/JA) where applicable
- Place documents under `docs/` or `examples/`
- Use consistent terminology in the SimpleModeling ecosystem
- Keep examples small but meaningful

---

## 6. Adding Documentation

Documentation contributions are highly valued.

You may contribute:

- SmartDox example files  
- Specs / RFC-style documents  
- Tutorials and QuickStart guides  
- Knowledge-modeling examples  
- Diagrams (UML, PlantUML, Semantic Message Flow diagrams)

Documentation is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

---

## 7. Tests

If your change affects code behavior, please add tests.

Test guidelines:
- Keep tests deterministic  
- Prefer small, unit-level tests  
- Add example-based tests for SmartDox transformations  
- Document expected behaviors in comments where helpful

---

## 8. Build Instructions

### Scala Projects
```
sbt compile
sbt test
sbt run
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (if Cozy uses JS output)
```
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```
